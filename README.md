# Dark Theme utils

A repository containing some useful utilities for dark mode.

All of these packages work everywhere, built on browser standards (Web Components).
With 1 small exception (`ThemeMixin`), these are completely dependency-free and should work anywhere out of the box.

## Features

- Theme Toggler webcomponent: UI component to toggle the theme
- Theme Mixin: Mixin to wrap your Web Components with that syncs an internal theme prop with global theme, for styling purposes.
- Anti-FART script (Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme)

### Theme Toggler

![toggler gif](https://github.com/jorenbroekema/dark-theme-utils/blob/main/assets/toggler.gif)

Toggler UI component that toggles the theme between "light" to "dark".

#### Toggler Features

- Visual UI toggle
- Accessible
- Extendible
- Works everywhere
- Responds to space, enter and all 4 arrow keys
- Uses OS/Browser color-scheme preference by default
- Responds to OS/Browser color-scheme preference changes
- Stores user preference in localStorage when toggling
- Sync theme state by listening to global `theme` attribute, meaning multiple togglers on the same page will work too

Using the toggler is pretty straight forward. Import the custom element definition file.

```html
<script type="module" src="dark-theme-utils/theme-toggler"></script>
<theme-toggler></theme-toggler>
```

Extending the toggler is also possible:

```js
import { ThemeToggler } from 'dark-theme-utils';

class CustomThemeToggler extends ThemeToggler {

}
customElements.define('custom-theme-toggler', CustomThemeToggler);
```

### Theme Mixin

When you have components utilizing ShadowDOM style encapsulation, you won't be able to style those components based on a global theme attribute out of the box.

`ThemeMixin` is a mixin utility that, when wrapping your ShadowDOM components, will reflect the global theme attribute to a local theme attribute.

> ThemeMixin depends on `@open-wc/dedupe-mixin` which is important for deduplicating multiple applications of this same mixin on a class.
> It relies on this dependency with a bare import specifier so for this component it is important that this is resolved to a relative/absolute path.

```js
import { ThemeMixin } from 'dark-theme-utils';

class FooElement extends ThemeMixin(HTMLElement) {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  }

  connectedCallback() {
    this.render();
  }

  render() {
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
    <style>
      :host {
        width: 20px;
        height: 20px;
        display: block;
        background-color: black;
      }

      :host([theme="dark"]) {
        background-color: white;
      }
    </style>
  `;
  }
}
```

As you can see, we have a selector `:host([theme="dark"])` which utilizes the fact that the ThemeMixin syncs the global theme attribute to the component.
`html[theme="dark"] :host` would not work.

> When the global theme attribute is changed, all components applying `ThemeMixin` change their theme attribute automatically.
> Every implementing component of `ThemeMixin` responds to a `MutationObserver` that watches the global theme attribute.

### Anti-FART script

FART (Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme) can happen when your page is rendering before the theme attribute has been set on the `html` element.

This means it will render `<html>` instead of `<html theme="dark">` which causes light-mode to render.
Right after, the code setting the theme executes, changing it to `<html theme="dark">`.
The user will see a flash of light theme because of this when (re)loading the page.

To prevent this from happening, we should set the initial theme attribute on the `html` element before anything renders,
which can be done by putting this script in the `<head>` of your page which will be parse-blocking, therefore first-render-blocking.

If you don't have any transpilation/compilation steps, you can put this in your `.html` file(s):

```html
<head>
  <script>
    const userPrefersDark = window.matchMedia(
      '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)',
    ).matches;
    const darkTheme =
      localStorage.getItem('theme-dark') ||
      (userPrefersDark ? 'dark' : 'light');
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('theme', darkTheme);
  </script>
</head>
```

If your HTML files are generated by a build-tool like Rollup or Webpack, which is probably more common, or by a dev-server during local development, you can import the `preventFart` function from the `dark-theme-utils` package and use these build-tools to bundle it and insert it into the `<head>`:

```js
/** 
 * 1) bundle this code so it is not using ES Modules
 * 2) insert it into head inside a script tag (without type="module"!) for html files
 */
import { preventFart } from 'dark-theme-utils';

preventFart();
```

> In the future, a prebundled prevent-fart.js will be published so you can just insert `<script src="...">` either manually or by build-tool.
